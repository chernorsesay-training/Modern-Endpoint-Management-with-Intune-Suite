# Modern Endpoint Management with Intune Suite: Project Plan

# Important note: 
The entire project was carried out from home. I have a physical server running Windows Server 2022 Data Centre and I setup Hyper-V with 2 secondary server on a VM for failover (cluster server). 

## 1. Project Overview and Goals
This project aims to implement a comprehensive, cloud-native endpoint management solution using the Microsoft Intune Suite. The primary goal is to enhance device security, streamline management processes, improve user experience, and ensure regulatory compliance for all corporate and user-owned devices.

Key Objectives:
* Centralize management of Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android devices.
* Implement a Zero Trust security model.
* Automate device provisioning, application deployment, and updates.
* Empower end-users with self-service capabilities and remote assistance.
* Gain deep insights into endpoint health and performance.

## 2. Project Phases and Steps
### Phase 1: Planning and Discovery (Weeks 1-3)
Step 1: Stakeholder Alignment: Identify and engage key stakeholders from IT, Security, HR, and department heads. Define project success criteria and establish a communication plan.

Step 2: Current State Assessment:
* Conduct a full inventory of all existing devices (corporate, BYOD), their operating systems, and versions.
* Docuent all current device management tools, processes, and policies (e.g., Group Policy Objects, SCCM).
* Review existing security policies, compliance standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), and business requirements.

Step 3: Define Scope and Licensing:
* Finalize the project scope, including which devices, applications, and user groups will be managed.
* Confirm Microsoft 365 and Intune Suite licensing requirements for all users and devices.

Step 4: Design the Management Architecture:
* Plan the Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) group structure for user and device assignments.
* Design a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model for IT administrators using scope tags.
* Determine the device enrollment strategy (e.g., Windows Autopilot for new devices, co-management for existing ones, BYOD with MAM).

### Phase 2: Technical Configuration (Weeks 4-8)
Step 5: Tenant and Core Configuration:
* Configure the Intune tenant and connect it with Microsoft Entra ID and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
* Set up core configurations such as conditional access policies, security baselines, and password policies.

Step 6: Device and Application Policies:
* Create and deploy device configuration profiles for various operating systems.
* Package and configure critical applications for deployment (e.g., Microsoft 365 Apps, Line-of-Business apps).
* Implement app protection policies to secure corporate data on BYOD devices.

Step 7: Intune Suite Feature Setup:
* Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM): Configure rules for standard users to request temporary elevation for specific tasks.
* Remote Help: Set up secure, role-based remote assistance for the helpdesk team.
* Advanced Analytics: Configure and review dashboards to gain proactive insights into device and application performance.
* Cloud PKI: Configure and deploy certificates for Wi-Fi, VPN, and authentication.

Step 8: Prepare for Migration:
* Create a phased migration plan for existing devices.
* Develop a communications and training plan for end-users to minimize disruption.

### Phase 3: Pilot Deployment and Testing (Weeks 9-11)
Step 9: Pilot Group Selection:
* Select a small, diverse pilot group of users and devices (e.g., IT staff, a low-risk department).

Step 10: Pilot Rollout:
* Enroll pilot group devices using the planned enrollment method.
* Deploy all configured policies, applications, and Intune Suite features to the pilot group.

Step 11: Feedback and Refinement:
* Actively monitor device compliance, security logs, and user feedback.
* Identify and resolve any issues, policy conflicts, or user-experience challenges.
* Refine configurations based on pilot feedback.

### Phase 4: Full Deployment and Migration (Weeks 12-16)
Step 12: Phased Rollout:
* Begin the full deployment in waves, starting with less critical departments or users.

Step 13: Communication and Training:
* Send pre-deployment notifications and provide access to user training materials.
* Announce the availability of new features like Remote Help and self-service portals.

Step 14: Decommission Legacy Systems:
* Gradually decommission old management systems like SCCM as devices are successfully migrated.

Phase 5: Operations and Maintenance (Ongoing)
Step 15: Continuous Monitoring:
* Use Intune reporting and Advanced Analytics to monitor endpoint health, compliance, and user experience scores.

Step 16: Policy and Application Updates:
* Regularly review and update security baselines and application versions.
* Plan for and test new features as they are released in the Intune Suite.

Step 17: User Support and Feedback:
* Maintain a dedicated support channel for user issues and new feature requests.

This project plan is a living document and should be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in organizational needs and new features from Microsoft.
