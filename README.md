# Modern-Endpoint-Management-with-Intune-Suite
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Zero Trust security model by leveraging the Microsoft Intune Suite to manage, secure, and automate endpoint administration.

# Important note: 
I design, implement the entire project from home. I have a physical server running Windows Server 2022 Data Centre and I setup Hyper-V with 2 secondary server on a VM for failover (cluster server).


# Modern Endpoint Management with Microsoft Intune Suite
This repository is a chronicle of my successful journey to implement a cloud-first endpoint management solution using the Microsoft Intune Suite. It contains the complete project documentation, including my initial project plan, the technical best practices I discovered along the way, and a detailed knowledge base I created to document my work.

## My Project at a Glance
I successfully transitioned my organization's device management from an old, on-premises system to a modern, cloud-native approach. By leveraging Microsoft Intune Suite, I created a more secure, efficient, and user-friendly environment for managing all devices, no matter where they are or who owns them. 
### The Features I Implemented
My project focused on setting up and configuring the following core components of the Intune Suite:

* Centralized Management: I now have a single, unified platform to manage all our Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android devices.
* Security Baselines & Policies: I put strong security in place by configuring pre-built and custom policies to protect our devices.
* Windows Autopilot: I automated the entire device setup process. Now, new employees can get their devices ready to go with almost no help from me.
* Application Management: I streamlined how we deploy and update all our essential corporate applications.
* Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM): I implemented a system that removed local administrator rights for users, but still allowed them to get temporary access for specific tasks. This greatly improved our security.
* Microsoft Intune Remote Help: I deployed a secure remote assistance tool that allows our helpdesk to quickly and safely assist users.
* Advanced Analytics: I set up the analytics dashboards to proactively find and fix issues with device performance and user experience.
* Microsoft Cloud PKI: I simplified the process of managing certificates for our devices, making secure connections much easier to handle.
